# Features Overview

The PageSpeed Insights MCP server provides a suite of tools designed to help you understand and improve your website's performance.

## 📊 Performance Analysis

At its core, the server allows you to run comprehensive performance audits using Google's Lighthouse technology.

*   **Full Reports**: Get detailed breakdowns of Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO, and PWA scores.
*   **Core Web Vitals**: Monitor real-world user experience metrics like LCP (Largest Contentful Paint), FID (First Input Delay), and CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift).
*   **Device Strategies**: Analyze your site as it appears on both **Mobile** and **Desktop** devices to ensure a responsive experience.

## 🔍 Advanced Diagnostics

Go beyond the score with detailed diagnostic tools:

*   **Visual Analysis**: See exactly what your users see with filmstrips and screenshots of the loading process.
*   **Network Waterfall**: Visualize the loading sequence of resources to identify bottlenecks.
*   **JavaScript Profiling**: Understand how script execution impacts your main thread and interactivity.
*   **Element Inspection**: Identify specific DOM elements that are causing layout shifts or slow paints.
*   **Image Optimization**: Find images that are too large, unoptimized, or causing layout shifts.

## ⚖️ Comparison & Benchmarking

*   **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Compare two different URLs to see how they stack up against each other. This is perfect for benchmarking against competitors or comparing staging vs. production environments.
*   **Batch Analysis**: Analyze multiple URLs in a single run to get a quick overview of a group of pages.

## 💡 Smart Recommendations

Don't just see the problems—solve them. The server includes a recommendation engine that:

*   **Prioritizes Issues**: Ranks problems based on their estimated impact on your score.
*   **Provides Actionable Fixes**: Gives you clear instructions on how to resolve specific issues.
*   **Estimates Savings**: Shows you how much time or data you could save by implementing the fixes.

## 🌍 Real-World Data (CrUX)
